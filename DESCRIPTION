Description: The 'devd' <https://github.com/cortesi/devd> utility is "a web daemon for 
    developers". It is written in the 'Go' programming language and distributed in both
    source and statically-linked, zero-dependency binary form. It's more lightweight
    than 'node.js' or 'Python' equivalents and designed to support front-end development
    tasks. It is a good companion for developing 'htmlwidgets' or other web-content.
